# Homework 3

To begin, I will load the tidyverse and instacart data, as well as set
knitr options.

## Problem 1

### data exploration

I will write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and
structure of the data, describing key variables, and giving illustrative
examples of observations:

The instacart dataset contains online grocery shopping data from 2017,
with 1384617 observations, or products from orders, and 15 variables,
for a total of 20769255 data points. Key variables include `order_id`,
`product_id`, `user_id`, whether items were `reordered`,
`order_hour_of_day` and `days_since_prior_order` (ranging from 0 to 30
), as well as `product_name` and associated `aisle` and `department`.

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 3
    ## # Groups:   aisle_id [134]
    ##    aisle_id aisle                          n_obs
    ##       <int> <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1       83 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2       24 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3      123 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4      120 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5       21 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6      115 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7       84 milk                           32644
    ##  8      107 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9       91 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10      112 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles. The aisles with the most ordered from items are
`fresh vegetables` and `fresh fruits`, followed by
`packaged vegetables fruits`.
