# Homework 3

To begin, I will load the tidyverse and instacart data, as well as set
knitr options.

## Problem 1

### data exploration

I will write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and
structure of the data, describing key variables, and giving illustrative
examples of observations:

The instacart dataset contains online grocery shopping data from 2017,
with 1384617 observations, or products from orders, and 15 variables,
for a total of 20769255 data points. Key variables include `order_id`,
`product_id`, `user_id`, whether items were `reordered`,
`order_hour_of_day` and `days_since_prior_order` (ranging from 0 to 30
), as well as `product_name` and associated `aisle` and `department`.
